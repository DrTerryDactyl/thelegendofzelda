You know, I think it's time I posted this stuff here:

Each enemy has a specific amount of health, and you can gauge exactly how much life an enemy has by using a variety of weapons on them. 
Some factors may deviate from this, such as the Boomerang killing weaker enemies, but stunning the rest. As well as being able to defeat a Dodongo with one sword strike, regardless of it's armor or health when stunned by a bomb blast.

Anyway. You can accurately measure damage and attack power, in hearts. 


Items:

Wooden Sword:1 heart damage
White Sword:2 hearts damage
Magical Sword:4 hearts damage
Boomerangs:0.5 hearts damage (Hurts weaker enemies only)(Stuns minor enemies)

Arrow:2 hearts damage
Silver Arrow:4 hearts damage
Blue/Red Candle:1 heart damage (0.5 hearts damage to Link)
Wand:2 hearts (Melee strike)(Fire does 1 heart damage to enemies and 0.5 hearts to Link)

The game uses two bytes to determine Link's health. One byte is for the last non-full heart (out of 255) and the other byte is for the number of full hearts and maximum hearts. This also goes up to 255, but works in a different way. The value is divided by 16, with the value +1 being the max number of hearts and the remainder being the number of full hearts. For example, if this byte was set to 250, Link would have 16 maximum hearts, 10 full hearts, and the 11th heart could be full or half empty as determined by the other byte
